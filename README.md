# ðŸ’¡ Assumptions Made

- Candidate data is stored locally in initialCandidates.js
- Each candidate has a rating (0â€“5) and an interviewed status
- Avatar colors are pre-defined in the data (bg-indigo-500, bg-green-500, etc.)
- Feedback is textual; longer notes are truncated with 'Read More / Show Less'
- No backend integration; all actions are handled in React state

# âœ¨ Extra Features Implemented

- Search and Filter by candidate name, role, rating, or status
- Sorting by rating, experience, or name
- Top Rated Badge for candidates with rating â‰¥ 4.5
- Expandable Feedback Notes with 'Read More / Show Less'
- View Feedback Modal with blurry background instead of alert
- Mark Interviewed Button disables for already interviewed candidates
- Responsive grid layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Hover effects and card animations for better interactivity
